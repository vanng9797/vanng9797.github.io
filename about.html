<br>As a Digital Media Artist, my main language of art is motion graphics. I was inspired by the striking visuals of Vocaloid and Korean Pop music videos. From digital illustrators, glitch artists, graphic artists, 3D artists and animators, the multidisciplinary collaboration of these artists spoke to me as what a Digital Media Artist is - the combination of these disciplines to create stories and emotions to the audience. <br>
<br>I started my artist journey with traditional art since I always love sketching, drawing and painting on paper. This passion has grown in me to a higher level once I discovered the beauty and limitless potential of digital art through many inspirations from the internet such as digital illustrations, designs, photo edits, then movies, animations and music videos. The Youtaite community was my introduction into Digital Media Art. A combination of the words “Youtube” and “Utaite” (歌い手), this Japanese phrase describes the faceless singers represented by digital avatars with heavily processed voices. This creative fandom unites singers, illustrators, sound designers, and animators to collaborate on song covers and music videos to share them with the world. Joining the Youtaite community was my first experience as a motion graphic designer in multi-disciplinary collaborations with many other artists across the world. By now, I have joined 5 competitions and contributed over 12 collaborative entries, creating various kinds of music videos that convey different concepts and stories. <br>
<br>My interest in music videos has taken me to discover many other genres of music, and Kpop quickly caught my attention, more specifically BTS and the visuals behind each of their music videos. BTS and their message to "Love Yourself" soon became a part of me as they have such great influences on how I interpret the world in general, and how I perceive music and arts in particular as an artist. I am continuously amazed at the creativity of the visual artists behind BTS. Their ability to weave together filmed footage, 3D animation, and motion graphics reminds me that there is no limitation when it comes to creating Digital Art. All of these inspirations have strongly inspired me to continue expanding my skills in motion graphics as well as video editing, with the purpose of creating compelling visuals that could tell stories, conveying meaningful messages to the audience, as well as spreading the emotions through my Digital Art. I believe that a successful artwork is one that makes my audience feel and experience the emotions my artwork is trying to convey. <br> 
<br>The hallmarks of these interdisciplinary collaborations and combinations of arts were immediately apparent to me that becoming a digital media artist is the right career path I have been searching for. Digital Media Art major is definitely the open door for me to explore all possibilities about Digital Art, as well as to pursue my ultimate passion for motion graphics and video editing.<br>
