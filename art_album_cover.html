    For my Art74 final project, I recreated Hope World album cover, with a goal of achieving a professional realistic-looking commercial work. During the making process, I always tried to keep balance of the three artistic methods, which are aesthetic, conceptual and technical.Since Hope World is a debut mixtape of South Korean rapper J-Hope (BTS member), I aimed for fonts and images that would represent the Hip-hop street style aesthetic, such as graffiti, paint strokes, grunge and a bit of old film grainy texture. I use mainly Adobe Photoshop that consists of multiple layers, images, and effects for this project. In this piece, I used png files of a mockup CD case and disk to mask it with my album cover. I created many layers of textures such as paint brushes, light leaks, holo foil, dust and film grain textures to create a look of old school hip hop style. I made several versions and did a lot of experiments on different typefaces, sizes, compositions as well as color schemes before I settled with the most potential one. Switching the layers to different modes like multiply, screen or overlay also helped me on deciding which one works best. I wanted to make sure that the typography and its position is well blended in with the composition of the cover, either on the case or on the disk. I paid much attention to the color scheme as I wanted it to look bright and hopeful just like the album name, yet still have a look that represents youth and independence. To compliment the project, I think it would be great to add in some photo cards like the gifts that are usually found in the physical album. Overall, I learned a lot from this project since I considered it one of my most professional looking artworks that I have ever done.
